# Reading List Extension

<img width="1027" alt="The reading list page, split into two sections with a form in between. The Unread section displays a list of links alongside buttons to save or delete each link. The Saved section is the same but with only delete button. There is a form in between to manually add a URL to the list." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ba33ba3-6ec5-46bf-b8da-5e8c18784e8f" />

## What it does

Opens a simple popup that allows you to add/remove the current page from a reading list. The full reading list can be opened in a new tab from the popup.

Uses the browser extension bookmarks API.

## Installation

I created this extension for my own personal use and as a fun way to learn more about browser extension development. I don't plan on publishing this to the browser extension stores. If you would like to try it out, you can clone this repo or download the `.zip` and follow [these instructions on installing a temporary add-on in Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/).

I may explore making this extension compatible with Chrome in the future.
